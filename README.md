## Brief Description
- DGP_RDD: It is the main data-generating process for the Monte-Carlo Simulation section
- First Stage_RDD_General: It is the simulation drawing 1000 points for testing and drawing 1000 points for training from DGP. The test points are fixed among 500 times iterations, and training points are changing.
