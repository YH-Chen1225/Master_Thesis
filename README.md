## Brief File Description
- **DGP_RDD**: It is the main data-generating process for the Monte-Carlo Simulation section
- **First_Stage_RDD_General**: It is the simulation drawing 1000 points for testing and 1000 points for training from DGP. The test points are fixed among 500 times iterations, and training points are changing.
- **First_Stage_RDD_Point**: It is the simulation for specifically experiment the points -1, -0.5, 0,0.5, 1 from the data-generating process.
- **Neural_Net_RDD**: It creates the synthetic data for second-stage simulation. The method is mainly from Susan Athey, Guido W. Imbens, Jonas Metzger, Evan Munro, Using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks for the design of Monte Carlo simulations,Journal of Econometrics,Volume 240, Issue 2, 2024,  105076,ISSN 0304-4076, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.013. Additionally, the data I generated was from paper Jens Ludwig, Douglas L. Miller, Does Head Start Improve Children's Life Chances? Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Volume 122, Issue 1, February 2007, Pages 159â€“208, https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.122.1.159. In total, there are 500,000 data be generated for the simulation.
- **Neural_Nets_Extension_Result**:It is the same synthetic data generating method as **Neural_Net_RDD**, but the generated data was from Connors AF Jr, Speroff T, Dawson NV, Thomas C, Harrell FE Jr, Wagner D, Desbiens N, Goldman L, Wu AW, Califf RM, Fulkerson WJ Jr, Vidaillet H, Broste S, Bellamy P, Lynn J, Knaus WA. The effectiveness of right heart catheterization in the initial care of critically ill patients. SUPPORT Investigators. JAMA. 1996 Sep 18;276(11):889-97. doi: 10.1001/jama.276.11.889. PMID: 8782638. Similarly, 500,000 data were generated.
